# Text-File-Encryptor-and-Decryption
This is a Text File Encryption and Decryption application for windows using C++ and the Qt Framework.

!ONLY FOR TEXT FILES!

How to use: ENCRYPT FUNCTION.
1. Press "Encrypt" button, the Files application for you to select a text file.
2. You enter a pin that must contain 6 digits.
3. Press the "Start" and it will encrypt your file.
4. A encrypted version of your file will be created afterwards you will be prompted to save an encrypted file. 

How to use: DECRYPT FUNCTION
1. Press "Decrypt" button.
2. The Files application will open for you to select the encrypted text file.
3. You enter the 6 digit pin that you used when you encrypted the file and press the "Start".
4. You will be prompted on where to save the decrypted text file.

When decrypting, it will not tell you whether your pin is correct or not, as this in my opinion is more secure and only if you know the correct pin, will the file be decrypted.
